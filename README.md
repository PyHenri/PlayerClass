# PlayerClass
a very simple 2D Player Class written in Python using Pygame (Pygame.org)

The project is a basic design pattern for a player class that includes player movement and drawing.

The Project could be used as the basic movement system in games like Platformers.

I created this project as an exercise to familiarise myself with classes.
