# PlayerClass
a very simple 2D Player Class written in Python using Pygame (Pygame.org)

The Project is a basic Pygame Player Class which includes movement and drawing the Player.

The Project could be used as the basic movement system in games like Platformers.

I created this project as an exercise to familiarise myself with classes.
